            This was the final Project Learning CSS designs in Georgian College Barrie ON,
            The objective of the last project was to create a modern website of a brand, could be an idea 
            for your pseudo business, future potential business, an existing business...etc, 
            either or you needed to create a modernized version of it. For Context, If you had this professor in last semester
            you were to create an e-commerce in the 1980s, in this box there is a link to provide the project page

            For me, I decided to go with Microsoft, because convienently, these was sort of the era of the birth of many microsoft's products
            But i am getting a ahead of myself
